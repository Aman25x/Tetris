# Tetris
---------------------------
---------------------------

## What is this project?:

For a 15-112 Homework Assignment, I created the game of tetris. Utilizing Object Oriented Programming, tKinter, and the
cmu_112_graphics.py, I was able to draw the pieces and their rotation.

## Files included:

Tetris.py is the python file that runs the code. Other files included in the repository include cmu_112_graphic files used for the graphics.

## KeyBoard Shortcut : 

Pressing d will allow for a hard drop feature, where the piece will fall straight down.
